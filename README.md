# South Korea Air Pollution and Weather Data Dashboard

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive air pollution and weather monitoring dashboard built using Grafana and InfluxDB on a Virtual Machine running Ubuntu Kibana. The dashboard visualizes pollution and auxiliary weather data to provide insights into air quality trends and factors affecting pollution levels in South Korea.

## Objectives

**1. Data Integration and Visualization**

•	Combine pollution data with weather parameters to uncover patterns and relationships.

•	Represent geographic distribution of pollution levels using latitude and longitude.

•	Track temporal trends of key pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO2) to identify seasonal and daily variations.

•	Forecast pollution levels for public safety and planning purposes.

**2.	Public Health and Policy Insights**

•	Provide actionable insights to South Koreans, enabling informed decisions about outdoor activities based on pollution forecasts.

•	Support policymakers with data to identify high-pollution areas and times, aiding in targeted interventions.

**3.	Technical Integration**

•	Demonstrate the use of open-source tools (Grafana, InfluxDB, and Ubuntu Kibana) for real-time data streaming and dashboarding.

•	Showcase a scalable pipeline for integrating and visualizing environmental data.
